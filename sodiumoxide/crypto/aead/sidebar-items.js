initSidebarItems({"mod":[["aes256gcm","WARNING: Despite being the most popular AEAD construction due to its use in TLS, safely using AES-GCM in a different context is tricky. No more than ~ 350 GB of input data should be encrypted with a given key. This is for ~ 16 KB messages - actual figures vary according to message sizes. In addition, nonces are short and repeated nonces would totally destroy the security of this scheme. Nonces should thus come from atomic counters, which can be difficult to set up in a distributed environment. Unless you absolutely need AES-GCM, use the default AEAD export instead - it doesn’t have any of these limitations. Or, if you don’t need to authenticate additional data, just stick to secretbox."],["chacha20poly1305","The original ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction can safely encrypt a pratically unlimited number of messages with the same key, without any practical limit to the size of a message (up to ~ 2^64 bytes)."],["chacha20poly1305_ietf","The IETF variant of the ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction can safely encrypt a practically unlimited number of messages, but individual messages cannot exceed 64*(2^32)-64 bytes (approximatively 256 GB)."],["xchacha20poly1305_ietf","The XChaCha20-Poly1305 construction can safely encrypt a practically unlimited number of messages with the same key, without any practical limit to the size of the message (up to ~ 2^64 bytes)."]]});
